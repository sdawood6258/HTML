anchor tag: anchor tag is used to connect another page/resource. 
It is done by 'a' tag and it uses attributes like 
href -- contains link/path to connect
target  -- we use _blank value to open new tab
        eg. <a href="link/path">Click Me </a>
        <a href="path to file" download>Click </a>


Images:
    We can insert images using img tag.
    img tag uses attributes like    
        src -- contains link or path of the images   (./  --> current folder,  ../ --> previous folder) 
        alt -- contains alternative title which works in the absense of src

    we can even set height & width of the images using height & width properties
